== Overview

This is a debian package that installs local copies of the DTDs for commonly
seen ONIX files. These DTDs are registered in the system XML catalog, allowing
libraries like libxml2 to use the local cached copies of the DTDs instead of
downloading them over and over.

This a niche package and I won't make any attempt to get it added to the debian
archive. If you need it, best to build and install it yourself. The package in
arch:all, so should install on both 32 and 64 bit systems as is.

== Building

  git clone git://github.com/yob/onix-dtd.git
  cd onix-dtd
  git-buildpackage

== Installing

  dpkg -i onix-dtd_1.0_all.deb
